In the backend, I have used the Springboot project with mysql database to store the all the information related to pizza (productID, productName, productSize, productImageUrl).
In the frontend i m using the fetch Api to fetch the details related of all the product...React-Router-Dom is used for navigation on different URL...
Context-API is used for live updating the count of products inside the cart
LocalStorage is used for Saving the cart items in the browser as i have not made the Api for adding product into the Cart
Tailwind is used for Styling
